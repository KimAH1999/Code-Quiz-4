# Code-Quiz-4
This project was to show my skill in creating a quiz application using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This Project has a count down timer, Start button prior to beginning, and a set of rules before showing first question in quiz. Then, when completing the quiz, the score will be given and an option to try again.
